# PintOS

A group-study of [Stanford's PintOS](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs140/projects/pintos/pintos.pdf), hoping to cover the entire implementation of the project and possibly some features beyond this given time-constraints.

The project's official web documentation and related files can be found [here](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs140/projects/pintos/)

Whenever compiling code please use these flags: ```-std=c17, -Wall, -Wextra, -Werror, -pedantic, -g, -O0, -o.```
